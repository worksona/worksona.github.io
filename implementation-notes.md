## Overview
Worksona.js is designed to be a lightweight, single-file solution for deploying and managing AI agents with distinct personalities across multiple LLM providers. It supports chat, image analysis, and image generation capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Agent Management:** Load, configure, and manage agents with distinct personalities.
- **Chat and Image Analysis:** Interact with agents using chat and analyze images.
- **Image Generation:** Generate, edit, and create variations of images using the agent's provider.
- **Events:** Listen for events to track agent operations and handle errors.

## Implementation Details
### Agent Class
The `Agent` class manages agent state, history, and metrics. It stores the agent's configuration, system prompt, examples, and traits.

### Worksona Class
The `Worksona` class is the main entry point for interacting with agents. It initializes providers, loads agents, and provides methods for chat, image analysis, and image generation.

### Providers
Worksona.js supports multiple LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Each provider is initialized with the appropriate API key and configuration.

### Events
Worksona.js emits events for various operations, such as agent loading, chat completion, and image analysis. These events can be listened to using the `on` method.

### Error Handling
Worksona.js provides detailed error messages for various scenarios. Errors are emitted as events and can be caught using the `on('error', ...)` method.

## Best Practices
- **API Keys:** Store API keys securely and avoid hardcoding them in your application.
- **Error Handling:** Listen for error events to handle errors gracefully.
- **Events:** Use events to track agent operations and update your application accordingly.
